    <h2>About Meltie</h2>
    <p><img src="meltie.jpg" alt="Meltie Photo"></p>
    <p>Through years of creating and exploring, Meltie has noticed some inefficiencies with living her wildest crafting dreams:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not have unlimited space for hobby supplies</li>
        <li>Does not have unlimited space to actually craft - cannot do pottery or rug tufting</li>
        <li>Craft zone not stable temp or ventilation, not ideal for 3D printing</li>
        <li>Some crafts have negative health factors, especially for babies and pets</li>
        <li>Does not have unlimited money to buy high quality tools</li>
        <li>Realized higher quality tools make the work easier and more fun</li>
        <li>Have excess supplies to donate after getting bored of hobbies, taking up too much space because I don't know who needs it and there is not a local place to donate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Meltie thought, how can I solve these problems? Other people must have the same issues. That is how Meltie's Workshop was created! Now Meltie and her team provide lessons, space, and supplies in a community-driven environment. Happy crafting!</p>
